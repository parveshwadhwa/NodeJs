1. Client sent a request to NodeJs Server.
2. Now request comes into Event Queue for queuing.
3. Then it will go to event loop , event loop is just like a machine which watch over event queue that any request comes or not and works in fifo manner
4. Now when we pick a request from a queue, it will be of two type 
   a. blocking operations (Synchronous)
   b. non blocking operations (Asynchronous)

5. Now incase of blocking operations, it will go to thread pool (containing threads) and then it will return result.
6. By default we have 4 threads/workers , Hence it will be preferable to use asynchronous/non blocking.
7. We can increase the thread/workers size depends upon the no. of cores of cpu on server/machine.
